# Chapter 8 Focal Imaging
This chapter describes the 2D and 3D impulse response and bandpass for imaging of spatially incoherent object distributions. 
It discusses depth of focus and depth of field. It also derives the bandpass for the mutual coherence and considers coherent mode decomposition
of focal distributions excited by incoherent sources. It considers PSF diversity to improve high-frequency response. Finally, considers imaging of partially coherent object distrubtions and radiance fields.
