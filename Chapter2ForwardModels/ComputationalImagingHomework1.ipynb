The course makes extensive use of jupyter notebooks and python due to the fact that these resources are freely available and they are tightly integrated with data science and deep learining tools. You are required to submit your homework inthe form of interactive python notebooks executable in the Google colab interface. Any libraries that you use should be available online or submitted with your work, we need to be able to run and test your code. \n",
