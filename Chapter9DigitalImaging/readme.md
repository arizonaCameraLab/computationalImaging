# Chapter 9 Digital imaging 

Chapter 9 reviews transduction of optical distributions to digital data. It introduces the system transfer function, combining the impact of the optical and pixel transfer functions. It discusses data upsampling, in the form of interpolation of display data from discrete samples, and data downsampling, in the form of image compression. It also discusses calibration of camera models and array camera image fusion.
